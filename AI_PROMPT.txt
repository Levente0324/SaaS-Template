I have a Next.js + Supabase + Stripe SaaS Template. I need you to transform it into the specific MVP Product detailed below. 

**MY PRODUCT IDEA:**
[INSERT_YOUR_BUSINESS_IDEA_HERE]
(Example: "A personalized workout routine generator that takes user goals, weight, and available equipment to instantly generate a 4-week gym plan.")

---

### YOUR INSTRUCTIONS (READ CAREFULLY & FOLLOW STRICTLY)

You are an expert full-stack engineer. You must execute this transformation surgically without breaking the existing secure infrastructure.

#### PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND THE BOUNDARIES (CRITICAL)
Before you write any code, you must understand what NOT to touch.
- **DO NOT** modify `lib/auth/*`. The authentication is strictly hardened.
- **DO NOT** modify `lib/billing/*`. The stripe integration is production-ready.
- **DO NOT** modify `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` or `app/dashboard/billing`. The redirect URLs and webhook payload error catches are highly optimized.
- **DO NOT** modify `middleware.ts` or `lib/rate-limit/index.ts`.
- **DO NOT** hardcode API keys anywhere. Always use `env.GEMINI_API_KEY`.

#### PHASE 2: THE "BRAIN" (`lib/ai/run-tool.ts`)
This is where the magic happens.
1. Scroll down to the `TOOL_REGISTRY`. 
2. Change the key from `demo` to a snake_case name matching my product (e.g. `generate_workout`).
3. **Rewrite the `prompt` string.** This is the SYSTEM PROMPT sent to the AI. Write an incredibly detailed, highly-constrained system prompt instructing the AI on exactly how to behave, what tone to use, and how to format the output for my specific product idea.
4. **Update the `schema` (Zod).** Replace the generic `input: z.string()` with the exact structured inputs my product requires (e.g. `z.object({ age: z.number(), goal: z.string(), equipment: z.string() })`).

#### PHASE 3: THE "DASHBOARD SKIN" (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
1. Re-design the UI form in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to collect all the inputs you defined in the Phase 2 Zod schema.
2. Update the `fetch("/api/ai/run")` block. Change `toolName: "demo"` to the new tool name you chose in Phase 2. Ensure you pass a JSON object containing the new input fields (e.g., `input: { age, goal, equipment }`).
3. Make the dashboard interface look professional, beautiful, and "Premium". Use Lucide-react icons, Tailwind CSS gradients, and clean card layouts (`rounded-xl border border-gray-200 shadow-sm`).

#### PHASE 4: THE "LANDING PAGE" (`app/page.tsx`)
1. Rewrite all the copy on the Landing Page to reflect my new Product. 
2. Change the Hero headline, the sub-headline, and the feature boxes to pitch the exact value proposition of my idea. 
3. Remove references to "AI SaaS Starter" or "Template". Give the app a cool name!

#### PHASE 5: THE DATABASE (ONLY IF REQUIRED)
If my product idea requires saving generated data (e.g. saving generated workout plans to view later):
1. Create a NEW file in `supabase/migrations/` named `002_add_product_tables.sql`. (Do not modify `001_schema.sql`).
2. Write raw SQL to create the necessary tables.
3. Every table MUST have a `user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
4. **CRITICAL:** You must append these exact RLS lines to your SQL:
   `ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
   `CREATE POLICY "select_own" ON your_table FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);`
   `CREATE POLICY "insert_own" ON your_table FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);`

**EXECUTION COMMAND:**
I have provided the constraints. Now, show me the code for `lib/ai/run-tool.ts`, `app/page.tsx`, and `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to make my product a reality. Go!
